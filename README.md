Real time Quality validation for streaming data using AI
# Real-Time Quality Validation of Streaming Data using AI and ML
Project Description:This project implements a system for real-time quality validation of streaming data using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The system monitors incoming data streams, analyzes their quality, and triggers alerts or actions if any quality issues (such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies) are detected. This is especially useful in IoT, sensor data, and monitoring systems.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quality-validation-streaming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd quality-validation-streaming
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up any environment variables (if necessary):
   ```bash
   export DATA_STREAM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```

5. Start the data streaming validation process:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Arguments:

--stream_source: URL or endpoint of the data stream.
--model: Path to the trained ML model used for data validation.
The script will connect to the data stream, analyze the incoming data, and output quality validation results in real time.
